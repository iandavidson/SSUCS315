Lab01

	Both classes, CollectionAU and CollectionAO are included for Lab01.
	CollectionAU has all features working properly. CollectionAO has been having
	an issue with using the function "assert" to check if deleted elements stay collection.
	Other than that, the functionality of CollectionAO is up to par with the lab requirements.
